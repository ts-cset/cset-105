# Editing Our Settings

- Which text editors have we seen so far? .eight[nano, vim, TextEdit]
- What two files configure BASH? .eight[.bashrc, .bash_profile]
- Which command reloads our settings? .eight[source]
- Which command creates a variable? .eight[export]

# Common Environment Variables

- .eight[$USER]
- .eight[$HOME]
- .eight[$PS1]
- .eight[$PATH]

Use .eight[echo $VARIABLE] to print the values for each variable.

# So what is the Environment?

# The environment is the context that your programs are running in.

# Where did this command come from?

- BASH looks through each directory in the $PATH
- When it finds the program, then it can run it

```sh
$ which nano
/usr/bin/nano
```

---

# Let's look at the PATH

```sh
$ echo $PATH
```

.fourteen[Is /usr/bin/ in the list of directories?]

---

# What else is in there?

```sh
$ ls /usr/bin/
```

.fourteen[Recognize anything?]

# .eleven[Time to get dangerous!]

We're going to break our $PATH

---

# Step 1: Make a new script

```sh
$ mkdir ~/scripts
$ cd ~/scripts
$ touch rm
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 zach  staff  0 Aug 27 12:45 rm
```

---

# Step 2: Make it executable

```sh
$ chmod +x rm
$ ls -l
total 0
-rwxr-xr-x  1 zach  staff  0 Aug 27 12:45 rm
```

---

# Step 3: Add lines to the script

```sh
$ nano rm
```

And add these lines to it:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World"
```

---

# Step 3b: Test the script

```sh
$ ./rm
Hello World
```

---

# Step 4: Add a directory to the $PATH

```sh
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
```

At the bottom, add this line:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"
```

---

# Step 4b: Update your settings

```sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

---

# Now try to delete your new script

```sh
$ rm rm
Hello World
```
