      <h2>Independent Discussions</h2>
      
      <p>
        After assigned readings, videos, or other work, we will frequently have a whole class discussion about the content. You're probably used to doing a reading and then having a quiz on it. I think that turns reading into a chore and I don't think it helps you learn anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, we're going to work together to come up with questions and topics to chat about. We'll practice at it, learning to develop better questions in order to have a deeper understanding of what we're working on.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you read, keep notes to make a list of all the <strong>thoughts</strong>, <strong>questions</strong>, and <strong>epiphanies</strong> you have about the work. If you can't think of any on your own, use these to spark some ideas:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What was interesting? Or uninteresting?</li>
        <li>Did anything surprise you?</li>
        <li>What could've been explained better?</li>
        <li>What seems most useful? Or least useful?</li>
        <li>Why does the author keep mentioning ___?</li>
        <li>How does this fit in with what you've already learned?</li>
        <li>What's your favorite quote from the reading?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Team Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        When you're done with the assignment, post your list in your team channel on Slack (blue, gold, gray, green, or red). As a small group, I want you to talk through the lists and pick the <strong>Top 2</strong> thoughts, questions, or epiphanies to share with the whole class. You might have to rewrite, clarify, or combine some of your ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically, which of your comments are the highest quality, most thought-provoking topics that we can discuss as a whole class?
      </p>

      <h3>Whole Class Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        When we get together as class, we'll go through each group's comments. I'll post in the appropriate course channel on Slack and, if one of your comments was chosen by your group, you can add your comment to the thread. We might not use them exactly as written, but they'll work as a starting point.
      </p>

      <h3>Is This Graded?</h3>

      <p>
        These discussions are part of your participation grade. Some people aren't comfortable talking with the whole class, so this allows everyone to participate at a level they are comfortable with.
