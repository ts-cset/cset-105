name: syntax

# Function Syntax

```javascript
// A
const add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;

// B
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// C
const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
```

---

# Arrow Functions

New in ES6

- Shortest syntax: `() =&gt; {}`
- See them a lot in later chapters
- Complex rules

```javascript
const greet = name =&gt; 'Hello ' + name;
const greet = (name) =&gt; {
  return 'Hello ' + name;
};
```

---

# Function Declaration

- Next shortest syntax
- Suffers from .eight[hoisting]

```javascript
add(1, 2);

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

This doesn't return an error. 


---

# Function Expression

Follows all the same rules as `let` and `const`.

```
add(x, y);

const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

This creates an error, but that's a good thing.

---

# Which Syntax?

1. Want it short and you know the rules? .eight[Arrow]
2. Want it simple and consistent? .eight[Expression]

Build good habits and avoid programming by coincidence with function declaration.

---
name: scope

# Scope

- Global: accessible anywhere
- Local: only accessible to the place it was defined

Local is relative. If it's local, then what is it local to?

---

# Scope

Two types of Local scoping rules:

- Lexical: only .eight[functions] create new scopes
- Block: any .eight[curly brackets] create new scopes

The keywords `let` and `const` follow Block scoping rules, while `var` follows Lexical rules.

---
name: hoisting

# Hoisting

Pre-ES6 term to describe how JavaScript separated .eight[declaration] from .eight[initialization]

```javascript
// declaration
var username;

// initialization
username = 'zach';
```

```javascript
var username = 'zach';
```

[MDN Reference: Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

# Hoisting Interview Question

```javascript
var x = 'outside';

function z() {
  console.log(x);
  var x = 'inside';
}

z();
```

What get's printed?

--

`undefined`

---
name: method

# What is a Method?

Methods are special functions.

- They're a set of instructions
- They can take inputs and create ouputs
- .fourteen[_They are tied to a specific object_]

---

# Example Method

```javascript
let x = 'hello';
x.toUpperCase()
// 'HELLO'

// instead of
toUpperCase(x)
```

The method `toUpperCase` is tied to the string.

---

# Another Method

```javascript
let x = 1.5;
x.toFixed(4);
// "1.5000"

x.toUpperCase();
// Error!
```

We have different methods depending on the data type.

---

# Helpful Methods

- [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
- [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)
- [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

Lots of handy tools for your toolbox!

---
name: closures

# Closures

When a local scope is created, is no longer actively being used, but sticks around because it's needed.

---
name: recursion

# Recursion

Imagine you are at a new friend's house and you need to get a glass from a kitchen cupboard. How would you find it?

.fourteen[Write an algorithm.]

---

# Recursion

```
Open cupboard
If glasses
  Take one
  Close cupboards and stop looking
If no glasses
  Pick new cupboard
  Start at top
```

---

# Recursion

- A function that can call itself.
- Compared to .eight[iterative] solution that deals with one at a time.

Some problems can be solved with both solutions, some can't.

---

# Needs Recursion

- Find an item in nested containers
- Find the shortest path between points

Don't know when to stop or how many possibilities there are.
