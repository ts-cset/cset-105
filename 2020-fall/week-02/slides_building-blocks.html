name: comments

# Comments

.eight[Lines of code that are ignored by the computer.]

# Comments

.eight[Lines of code that are ignored by the computer.]

- For us, the humans
- Explain _what_ the program does
- More important: _why_ the program is doing it

```js
// Comments start with 2 slashes
```

---
name: expressions

# Expressions vs Statements

.eight[Expressions are pieces of code that produce a value.]

- Just like words and phrases in a full sentence, expressions are pieces of code statements.
- A program is a list of statements, or lines of code.

---

# Expressions vs Statements

How many expressions are in this statement?

```js
100 + 4 * 11;
```

---
count: false

# Expressions vs Statements

- .eleven[100] + .eleven[4] * .eleven[11];
--
count: false
- 100 + .eleven[4 * 11];
--
count: false
- .eleven[100 + 44];
--
count: false

Five total expressions in a one small statement.
---
name: variables

# Creating a Variable

.eight[A named place to catch and hold on to values.]

- Now our values can stick around for the whole program.
- Use variables just like values, by writing their name.
- Different kinds of variables depending on if it will change or where it can go.

---

# Algorithm to Create a Variable

- **name**: what do we call it?
- **type**: what type of data will it hold?
- **initialValue**: what will it start holding?

---
# Algorithm to Create a Variable

Create a variable called **name** of type **type** that starts with the value **initialValue**.
--
count: false

```js
let name = initialValue;
```

---
name: functions

# Functions

.eight[Mini algorithms built into JavaScript.]

- They're **abstractions**. Don't need to know _how_ it works, just _how_ to use it.
- We'll learn two right now.
- We'll build our own later.

---

# Algorithm to Show Output

- **message**: text to show to user

---

# Algorithm to Show Output

Output the text **message**.
--
count: false
```js
console.log(message);```

---

# Algorithm to Get Input

- **variable**: where to store value from user
- **message**: question to ask the user

---

# Algorithm to Get Input

Ask the user **message** and store the answer in **variable**.
--
count: false
```js
let variable = prompt(message);
```

---

# Let's Write A Program

.fourteen[Ask the user for two numbers, add them, and show the result.]

- Write it on paper.
- Don't use code!
- Just write the algorithm:
  - Create A Variable
  - Show Output
  - Get Input

---

# Let's Write A Program

1. Write the algorithm.
2. Convert to comments.
3. Fill out comments with code.
4. Test the code.

# When Things Don't Work

- This is _debugging_ and it's normal.
- Did you tell it what to do _incorrectly_?
- OR, did you tell it to do the _wrong thing_?

More often than not, it's a problem with the algorithm.

---
name: conditionals

# Conditionals

.eight[Different paths the program can take.]

- Normally, a program runs from top to bottom in a straight line.
- You can wrap parts of the program to run only _some_ of the time.
- These conditionals can become very complex with many branches.

---

# Algorithm to Make a Branch

- **condition**: true/false value
- **code**: one or more lines of code

---

# Algorithm to Make a Branch

If **condition** is true, execute **code**.
--
count: false
```js
if (condition) {
  code
}
```

---
name: loops

# Loops

.eight[When code needs to run over and over again.]

- Similar to branches, but with repetition.
- Most complex algorithm yet, can lead to lots of bugs.
- Most useful. Never copy/paste code, use a loop.

---

# Algorithm to Make a For Loop

- **counter**: integer variable that will control the loop
- **start**: value of counter at beginning
- **end**: value of counter at end
- **change**: value to add to counter after each cycle

---

# Algorithm to Make a For Loop

Begin with **counter** variable at **start** and add **change** on each cycle until **counter** is larger than or equal to **end**.
--
count: false
```js
for (let counter = start; counter < end; counter = counter + change) {
  code
}
```

---
name: extras

# Extra Rules and Features

- Allowable names and capitalization rules
- When to indent lines of code
- Branching with Switch
- Looping with While or Do While
- Breaking out of Loops early
- Shortcut to update variables

---

# Building Blocks in Other Languages

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char userName[20];
  printf("What is your name? ");
  scanf("%s", userName);
  printf("Hi there, %s!", userName);
  return(0);
}
```

---

# Building Blocks in Other Languages

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Hello {
  public static void main (String[] args){
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    String userName;
    System.out.println("What is your name?");
    userName = input.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Hi there, " + username + "!");
  }
}
```

---

# Building Blocks in Other Languages

```python3
userName = input("What is your name?")
print(f"Hi there, {userName}")
```

```js
let userName = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(`Hi there, ${userName}`);
```
