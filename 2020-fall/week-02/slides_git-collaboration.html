Collaborating with Git

# Quick Tip: .eight[Help]

```bash
$ git help
  # provides list of common commands
$ git help &lt;command&gt;
  # provides man page for specific command
$ git help add
```

???
Frequently, you'll see a word in angle brackets in the man pages.
No, this isn't an HTML tag. Wrong class. It's a variable, it means
replace this entire thing with what you actually want.

# Remote Repositories

- Create, view, and delete connections to other repos
- Kind of like a bookmark for a URL
--

- .eleven[Sharing between remotes is not automatic]

???
URLs aren't easy to remember or use.
We need to pull upstream commits into local repo
and push local commits back up to central repo.

---

# Central Repositories

GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or your own server!

- .eight[Redundancy]: imagine your hard drive fails...
- .eight[Convenience]: imagine our connected repos, but your computer is off...
- .eight[Security]: imagine your computer constantly accepting changes from everyone...

![Diagram of remote repos](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:df13d351-6189-4f0b-94f0-21d3fcd66038/01.svg)

# `origin &amp; john`

---

# .eight[Remote]

```bash
$ git remote
  # lists remote connections
$ git remote -v
  # lists remote connections, including URLs (it's Verbose)
```

---

# Repo URLs

Compare the following Repo URLs
```bash
http://host/path/to/repo.git
ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git
```

--

Two protocols to connect to the same repo.

???
New protocol. Host is just computer name, like github.com.
HTTP is useful for anonymous read-only
SSH is way more secure. You authenticate in order to have write access

# .fourteen[Where did those remotes come from?]

---

# .eight[Origin]

- .eight[git clone] automatically creates a remote pointing at the original
- That remote is called .eight[origin]
- Use the origin to pull .eight[upstream] changes or publish your own

---

# .eight[Remote]

```bash
$ git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;URL&gt;
  # adds a new remote, for example:
  # git remote add origin https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-105.git
$ git remote show &lt;name&gt;
  # shows details about remote
```

???
Also git remote remove and rm, which are self-explanatory, but seldom used

---

# Try it!

```bash
$ cd ~/my-repo
$ git remote -v
$ cd ~/cset-105
$ git remote -v
```

# Branches

![Git Branch Diagram](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:746be214-eb99-462c-9319-04a4d2eeebfa/01.svg)

---

# .eight[Branch]

- Bookmark for a certain commit
- That commit knows it's history, not the branch
- Think of a branch as a series of commits, not a container for commits

---

# .eight[Branch]

```bash
$ git branch
  # lists local branches
$ git branch -r
  # lists remote branches
$ git branch -a
  # lists all branches
```

---

# Branch

Creating a repo with `git init` creates a default branch called `master`.

- Consider this the "main" branch
- Other branches can be created or deleted

---

# Look At Another Branch

```bash
$ git checkout <branch>
$ git checkout master
```

Think of "checkout" like a library book:
- Grab commits from a branch
- Change the files to show that branch

---

# Combine Branches

Work from one branch can be added into another branch.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge new-feature
```

This added changes from the .eight[new-feature] branch into the .eight[master] branch.

![Syncing From a Remote](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:1774e4e9-6945-4a66-9f0f-329f0bef24cb/hero.svg)

---

# Syncing Files

Three places for files now:

1. The actual files on your computer: .eight[working directory]
2. The information tracked in git _locally_
3. The information tracked in git _remotely_

---

# Syncing with Fetch

- Downloads commits and .eight[refs] into your local repo
- Doesn't make any changes to your working directory
- View these changes by using .eight[git checkout] command
- Safer of the two options


---

# .eight[Fetch]

```bash
$ git fetch
  # fetches all branches
$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;
  # fetches a specific remote branch
```

---

# Try it!

```bash
$ cd ~/cset-105
$ git status
$ git fetch origin
$ git status
```

---

# Advanced Topic

Read up on how to use fetch, checkout, log, and merge to get changes safely:

[Advanced Git Fetch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch)

---

# .eight[Pull]

- Downloads commits and refs into your local repo
- Immediately updates your working directory to match
- Shortcut for .eight[git fetch; git merge]
- Destructive, but easier to learn

???
Totally fine to use now, if it's easier for you

# Practice

- Do to [LearnGitBranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- Complete "Introduction Sequence" on Main tab
- Complete "Push &amp; Pull -- Git Remotes" on Remote tab
