name: difference

# What's the difference?

- Syntax: .eight[rules of the language]
- Style: .eight[conventions of the language]
- Broken syntax rules lead to broken programs.
--

- Broken style rules lead to broken _understanding_.
--


.eleven[Syntax is for machines. Style is for us.]

---
name: naming

# Naming Variables

- Any word, including alphabetical and numeric characters
- Can include `$` and `_`, but no other special characters
- Can't _start_ with numeric character
- Can't be a reserved keyword, like `for` or `new`

If you forget these rules, the program will break and the error will tell you.

---

# Naming Style

- Use names with meaning: `counter` is more helpful than `x`
- Use `camelCase` for more than one word for readability
--

- Special things start with capital letters: `Number` and `Math`
--

- Other special things start with underscore

---

# Assignment

- You can assign multiple variables on one comma-separated line
- Usually best to separate the different ideas

```
// okay
let one = 'A', two = 'B';

// better
let user = "Zach";
let loggedIn = true;
```

---
name: semi-colons

# Semi-Colons

- Used to separate statements, complete thoughts of code
- JS will add missing semi-colons while it's running
--

- Problem: lines .eleven[!=] statements
--

- Can put many statements on one line
- Can split long statements into many lines

---

# Semi-Colon Errors

Two Types:

- JS combines two lines into one statement, instead of your intended two statements
- JS break two lines into two statements, instead of your intended one statement

Always adding semi-colons prevents the first error.

---

# Semi-Colon Usage

Correct syntax:
```
let number = 10;
console.log(number);
number += 5;

let novel = "Once upon a time ..."
  + "... they lived happily ever after";
```

---

# Semi-Colon Usage

Bad style:
```
console.log
('hello')
```

Bad syntax:
```
return
  "really long line...";
```

---
count: false

# Semi-Colon Usage

Bad style:
```
console.log
('hello');
```

Bad syntax:
```
return undefined;
  "really long line...";
```

---
name: new-lines

# New Lines

- After semi-colons
- After open curly brackets
- When you need to split up long lines

Suggestion: Add an extra empty line to create sections of code and separate ideas.

---
name: curly-brackets

# Curly Brackets

- Used to group any number of statements into one, called a block 
- Not needed for one statement, but good practice
- Conditionals, Loops, and more make use of blocks
- Open the bracket at the start of the block
- Close the bracket on new line at end

---

# Curly Brackets

```
block {
   statements;
}
```

---
count: false

# Curly Brackets

```
block {
   statements;
} block {

}
```

Chained blocks should start on same line that the previous block ended.

---
name: indenting

# Indenting Code

- Helps visually represent the structure of the code
- JS usually uses 2 space _characters_
--

- Tab key might create space characters, depending on editor settings
- Tab character is variable width, depending on settings
--


I don't care which, as long as you're **consistent** about using the same character.

---
name: spacing

# Spacing Code

- Not counting indentation, spaces are used to separate pieces of code
- JS uses these space characters to stop translating one idea and start the next
- Extra spaces can make things more readable

---

# Spacing Code

Around operators:
```
(2 * 3) - 1 === 5;
```

Between block keywords and brackets:
```
if (true) {

do {
```

---
name: parentheses

# Parentheses

- Needed for some block keywords
- Needed for reordering operators
- Needed for _calling_ functions
- Extra parentheses are useless

---

# Parenthesis

For calling functions:
```
prompt("What's your name?");
```

Useless parentheses:
```
let number = (4 * 10);

if ((3 &gt; 2) &amp;&amp; (2 &gt; 1)) {
```

---
name: style-guides

# Professional Style Guides

- [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
- [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [jQuery](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)

Companies and big projects use them to stay consistent, regardless of the number of developers.
