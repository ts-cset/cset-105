    CSET-110 Lab:<br>
    Git Collaboration
  </h1>

  <p>
    Today, we're going to practice our git workflow with remote repositories. We are going to use our Project Structure labs from last week as our git project. We'll create a repo on Github and push our projects to it. From there, we can practice our new git commands and use some of the tools that Github provides.
  </p>

  <p>
  You'll have to follow the directions below very carefully, some of it will be new information. When it refers to your "collaborators," look at the list I provided in Discord. You should have two names. You'll have to complete the instructions I provided for <strong>each</strong> of your collaborators' projects. Use Discord to post your repository URL for people who have your name.

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Initialize your project as a git repo, then add and commit your files. Create a new repo on Github with your project's name, but <strong>don't</strong> select "Initialize with a Readme". Follow their steps to push an existing repository from the command line. You'll need to add your new Github repo URL as a new remote called <em>origin</em> and push your commits to it.</li>
    <li>Share your repo URL in Discord for your collaborators. If you finished step one and you're waiting on them, go help them out!</li>
    <li>For each of your collaborators:
      <ul>
        <li>Create a fork of their repo on Github and clone it to your computer. If you don't know how to do that, you can follow <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">this guide</a> to learn.</li>
        <li>Review their code and submit at least <strong>2</strong> Github Issues on <em>their</em> repo, not your fork. They can be constructive criticisms of HTML syntax or semantics, or they can be recommended improvements to the site. Remember to be respectful or they won't take your issue seriously.</li>
        <li>For <strong>1</strong> of those issues, make your recommended modification(s) and push them to <em>your</em> fork on Github.</li>
        <li>Then submit a Pull Request on to the original repo. You should link it to the issue that you're trying to solve.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For your repo:
      <ul>
        <li>Respond to <strong>all 4</strong> of the submitted issues.</li>
        <li>Accept and Merge at least <strong>1</strong> of the Pull Requests from your collaborators. (If you don't like any of the Pull Requests, you can always look up the <code>git revert</code> command to change it back.)</li>
        <li>For at least <strong>1</strong> of the issues that do not have a Pull Request, make the modifications yourself and push them to your repo. <em>You should wait until both of the PRs have been submitted so you don't duplicate the work of your collaborators. Also, make sure you Pull any changes into your local repo before you start working. You want to make your changes on top of their changes.</em></li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
