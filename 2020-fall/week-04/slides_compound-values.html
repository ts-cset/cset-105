name: primitives

# Primitive Values

Smallest .eight[immutable] pieces of data.

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Empty Values (kinda...)

---

# What is Immutability?

A value that cannot be changed, or mutated.

```javascript
let num = 2;
num = num + 3;
console.log(num); // 5
```

- Three values were created separately.
- The variable was bound to one value, then another.

---

# What is Immutability?

```javascript
let name = 'CSET';
name.toLowerCase(); // 'cset'
console.log(name);  // 'CSET'
```

- Two values were created separately.
- The string method didn't mutate the string

---

# Primitive Limitations

```javascript
let courseName = 'Intro To Web Applications';
let courseNumber = 105;
let courseProgram = 'CSET';
```

How can we keep these related pieces of data together?

---

# Primitive Limitations

```javascript
let courseTwoName = 'Web Development I';
let courseTwoNumber = 110;
let courseTwoProgram = 'CSET';
```

Creating separate but related variables for many things gets overwhelming.

How many variables will I need?

---
name: compounds

# Compound Values

A collection of different pieces of data.

- One variable is bound to many values
- Also known as Data Structures
- Common structures across many languages, though names are different
- .eight[Objects] and .eight[Arrays]

---
class: center, middle

# _Forget what you know about Object-Oriented Programming._

---
name: objects

# Objects

An Object is a collection of properties.

- .eight[Property] values can be any data type
- These inner values are bound to a .eight[key]
- We can add more, update them, or remove them

.fourteen[Analogy:] Think of a file cabinet. A single cabinet holds many named files, each file holds information.

---
name: object-syntax

# Object Syntax

Let's turn this into an Object:

```javascript
let courseName = 'Intro To Web Applications';
let courseNumber = 105;
let courseProgram = 'CSET';
```

---
count: false

# Object Syntax

Let's turn this into an Object:

```javascript
let course = {
  name: 'Intro To Web Applications',
  number: 105,
  program: 'CSET',
};
```

---

# Object Syntax

```javascript
let variable = {
  key: value,
};
```

- Open brackets to hold list of properties
- Name each property with a valid variable name
- Assign any value to the key using a colon `:`
- Separate properties with a comma `,`

---

# Object Syntax

Get values from inside an object:
```javascript
console.log(course['name']);
// 'Intro To Web Applications'

console.log(course.name);
// 'Intro To Web Applications'
```

First syntax is called Bracket Notation, second is Dot Notation.

---

# Object Syntax

Because Objects can hold other Objects, this can get long:

```javascript
console.log(programs.cset.course.name);
```

Containers for containers.

---

# Object Syntax

Update a property, or add a new one:
```javascript
course.name = 'Some new value';
```

Remove a property:
```javascript
delete course.name;
console.log(course.name); // undefined
```

---
name: arrays

# Arrays

An Array is a special Object built like a list.

- A collection of .eight[elements] of any size
- Element values can be any data type
- Bound to an .eight[index] according to order

.fourteen[Analogy:] Think of a 3-ring binder. A binder holds many pages in order, each page holds information.

---

# What's the difference?

- Objects hold .eight[properties], values bound to a .eight[key].
- Arrays hold .eight[elements], values bound to an .eight[index].

Use Objects when you need names for inner values. Use Arrays when you need order.

---
name: array-syntax

# Array Syntax

Let's turn this into an Array:

```javascript
let student1 = 'Amy';
let student2 = 'Bob';
let student3 = 'Cathy';
let student4 = 'Dave';
```

---
count: false

# Array Syntax

Let's turn this into an Array:

```javascript
let students = [
  'Amy',
  'Bob',
  'Cathy',
  'Dave',
];
```

---

# Array Syntax

- Open square brackets to hold list of elements
- Separate elements with a comma `,`

---

# Array Syntax

Access an element in an Array:
```javascript
console.log(students[1]);
// 'Bob'
```

.fourteen[Why did we see 'Bob'?]

---

# Cardinal vs Ordinal

- Cardinal numbers are for .eight[C]ounting: one, two, etc.
- Ordinal numbers are for .eight[O]rder: first, second, etc.

Computers start counting at zero.

```javascript
console.log(students[0]); // 'Amy'
```

---

# Array Syntax

Update an element:
```javascript
students[2] = 'Charles';

console.log(students);
// ['Amy', 'Bob', 'Charles', 'Dave'];
```

Removing is a little harder...
```javascript
students.splice(2, 1);
// ['Amy', 'Bob', 'Dave'];
```

---

# Why did we talk about immutability?

```javascript
let student = {
  name: 'Amy',
  courses: 2,
};
student.courses += 1;
```

Did our value get mutated?

---

# Why did we talk about immutability?

```javascript
let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
letters.push('d');
console.log(letters);
// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

Did our value get mutated?
