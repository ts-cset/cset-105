# .fouteen[Why Use Branches?]

---

# Use Branches to Encapsulate Changes

- Avoids new unstable code in main code base
- Clean up history before merging
- Work in parallel

---

# .fouteen[How Do We Use Branches?]

---
class: middle

```bash
$ git checkout -b &lt;new-branch&gt;
$ git checkout &lt;existing-branch&gt;
```

???
By default, bases off of current HEAD

---

# Checkout Updates `HEAD`

- `HEAD` refers to the current snapshot
- Branch (which points at a Commit) or Commit
- New Commits are part of a Branch's line of development
- New Commits can't exist outside of a line of development

# Merging Branches is merging two different lines of development.

---

# Two Types of Merge

- .eight[Fast Forward Merge]: linear update to target branch
- .eight[Three Way Merge]: non-linear combination of source and target branches

# .fourteen[Why do I keep seeing .DS_Store files?]

---

# git rm

- The opposite of `git add`
- Remove files tracked by git
- Or remove files from both the staging area and the working directory

---

# Let's Remove Them

If you already commited a file and want to remove it from history AND delete it:
```bash
$ git rm path/to/file
```

If you want to remove from git but keep the file on your machine:
```bash
$ git rm --cached path/to/file
```

---

# .fourteen[Uh... I still see .DS_Store files.]

---

# Let's Ignore Them

In your terminal:
```bash
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

---

# Let's Ignore Them

- A .eight[gitignore] file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
- Usually project specific in a file at `my-project/.gitignore`
