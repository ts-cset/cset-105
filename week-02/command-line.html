# Files and Folders

- Files are buckets of bits stored somewhere on your machine
- Folders are directories, special files pointing at regular files
- Names are paths, or locations
  - Absolute paths are the steps to get to a file from the root directory
  - Relative paths are the steps to get to a file from your current directory

---

# Basic Commands

- navigate the filesystem: .eight[pwd, ls, cd]
- make files/folders: .eight[touch, mkdir]
- remove files/folders: .eight[rm, rmdir]
- duplicate or rename files: .eight[cp, mv]
- examine files: .eight[cat, less]
- get help: .eight[man]

---

# Basic Commands

- enter after a prompt: .eight[$]
- then tweak with options/flags
- then provide arguments

# Shell Shortcuts
