      <h2>Week 2: Controlling the Flow of a Program</h2>

      <p>Main Objective: Learn the basic building blocks of all programming languages to solve simple algorithms.</p>

      <p>Lessons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="building-blocks.html">Building Blocks of a Program</a></li>
      </ol>

<!--       <p>Practice Problems:</p> -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!--         <li><a href="practice_values-types-operators">Values, Types, and Operators</a></li> -->
<!--       </ul> -->

      <!-- <h3>Project:</h3> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Follow the <a href="project_github-setup.html">project instructions</a> as best you can. You can ask for help from your team or the tutors, if needed. All work is due Friday, August 28th, by midnight. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      

      <!-- <h3>Assessment:</h3> -->
      <!-- <p>Follow these <a href="https://ts-cset.github.io/first-year/policies/assessments/">guidelines</a> to answer the following questions. Due Friday, August 28th, by midnight.</p> -->
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!--   <li>In your opinion, what is the most important thing you learned this week? Why?</li> -->
      <!--   <li>Describe the general idea of high and low level programming languages using the concept of abstraction.</li> -->
      <!--   <li>JavaScript was designed to be flexible with values and types, often jumping back and forth between them. Compare some pros and cons of this decision. How might it help you? How might it get in the way?</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->

            <li>The first two lessons, "Introduction" and "Conditionals" will closely match this week's chapter.</li>
            <li>They introduce "Functions," "Scope," and "Arrays" next. We haven't learned so don't worry about them yet. Although some parts of lesson six on "Loops" will rely on them.</li>

            <li>The lessons "Comment Your JavaScript Code" through "Understand String Immutability" will match this week's chapters. If you get to "Arrays," you're going beyond what we're learning.</li>
            <li>This lesson uses an older version of JavaScript, so look at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/" target="_blank">the first three lessons</a> in their unit on ES6, the version of JS we're learning.</li>
