# Install Git

Check if you have it:
```sh
$ git --version
git version 2.28.0
```

If you don't:
```sh
$ brew install git
```

# What is Version Control?

A programming tool to:

- .eight[Track History] to see how the project changes over time
- .eight[Branch] into different versions of the project
- .eight[Collaborate] with others safely, from a small team to thousands of strangers

???
SCM: Source Code Management
VCS: Version Control System
So why is this important?

A version control system

Enter git
Not github

A separate business with supporting tools for git

# Short History

1. Linux operating system created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
2. Changes were passed around as patch files over email
3. Switched to a proprietary DVCS in 2002 called BitKeeper
4. Had to start paying for it 2005, so they ditched it and built their own

[Linux Source Code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

???
Distributed VCS

# How does it work?

---
name: terms

# Basic Terms

1. .eight[Repository]: the folder that holds your project, and all the history
2. .eight[Commit]: a snapshot of the project files at a point in time
3. .eight[Branch]: a series of commits over time
4. .eight[Remote]: another computer that also stores the repository

There are way more than this, but this gets us started.

---

# Generic Workflow

1. You start a project and initialize it as a git .eight[repository]
2. As you work, you save changes in .eight[commits]
3. Those .eight[commits] update a .eight[branch]
4. If you want to share or backup your code, you push your changes to a .eight[remote] 

---
name: configure

# Git Configuration

Git should be installed by now, let's add our info.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your@email.com
```

.eleven[Use the same email address as your GitHub account!]

---

# Git Configuration

- A place to store your settings
- System, .eight[User], and .eight[Local] settings
- `/etc/gitconfig` .eleven[&lt;] `~/.gitconfig` .eleven[&lt;] `.git/config`

```bash
$ git config -l
$ git config core.editor
```

???
You might see vim, if you don't want that you can change it to nano.

---

# Git Configuration

Git will sometimes open an editor for you to make notes, pick one that you're familiar with:

```bash
$ git config --global core.editor "vim"
$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"

$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

---
name: usage

# Basic Git Usage

Depends on our purpose

- Create a Repository for a new project?
- Track Changes while working on the project?
- Sync Changes when done working?

---

# Create A Repository

Option 1: New repo on your computer

```bash
$ cd ~/code
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ git init
```

.eleven[You only need to do this once.]

---

# Create A Repository

Option 2: Copy an existing repository

```bash
$ cd ~/code
$ git clone https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-105.git
$ cd cset-105
```

---

# Check The Status

See the three states of your files

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

.eleven[You'll be typing this all the time.]

---

# Possible File States

- .eight[Untracked]: git doesn't know about the file yet
- .eight[Staged]: the file has been marked to be included in the next commit snapshot
- .eight[Unmodified]: the file has been committed
- .eight[Modified]: the file has changed from the last commit

---

# Possible File States

![File lifecycle](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png)

---

# Tracking Changes

The process of 

- Editing
- Staging
- Committing

So you've made some changes? Let's save a snapshot:

---

# Stage Changes

Move .eight[untracked] or .eight[modified] files to .eight[Staging Area]

```bash
$ git add some-file.txt
$ git status
...
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

          new file:   some-file.txt
```

---

# Commit Changes

Save a snapshot of the project right now

```bash
$ git commit
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

# Sync Changes

Share or backup the project to the .eight[remote]

```bash
$ git push
```

---
