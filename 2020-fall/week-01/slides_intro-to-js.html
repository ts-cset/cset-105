# Operating a Calculator

- Different colored buttons according to what they do.
- Light gray buttons are .eight[values]
- Orange buttons are .eight[operators]
- Like "nouns" and "verbs", these values and operators function differently.

---

# Operating a Calculator

- .eight[Operator] is a fancy word for an action, it does something to the values.
- In math, operators work on values but not other operators.
- `2 + 3` makes sense
- `x + -` doesn't make sense

---

# Values and Operators in Programming

Our first steps in programming will be using these using these values and operators like a fancy calculator:

- Numbers
- Text
- Logic

These are examples of .eight[data types].

---

# Types of Values

The type of a value determines what operations you can do with it, the "role" it plays in your program.

---

# Math?!

These types and operators can be combined to do complex and interesting things:

- Calculate compound interest in your banking app
- Create organic looking motion in an animation
- Crunch statistics for a recommendation algorithm
- Determine if a video game character is running into a wall

# Why JavaScript?

- High-level, so we don't have to think about the details
- One of the three core web technologies, so it's everywhere
- Scripting language, so you can use it to solve many types of problems

It's the [most popular language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology), so you can get hired for it.

# So How Does It Work?

# So How Does It Work?

At this point, most other courses would:

- Explain how the Internet and HTTP works
- Teach you HTML and CSS
- And make you program for a web browser

That's a lot of problems to solve all at once...

# When Things Get Complicated

# .eight[Break It Into Smaller Problems]

---

# Thinking Like A Programmer

To solve a problem, you need to:

1. Figure out the solution
2. Convert the solution to code

Doing both at once makes the problem harder.

---

# Thinking Like A Programmer

- So we'll forget about the internet for now
- We'll solve simpler, smaller problems
- Then we'll add in complexity later

Have patience :)

# Reading Like a Programmer

Levels of technical reading, from high to low:

- Tutorial or Guide
- Interpretation of Docs or Specs
- Documentation or Specification
- Source Code

Just like levels of programming languages, higher levels are abstractions of the lower levels.

---

# Reading Like a Programmer

- Higher levels give you mileage
- Lower levels give you depth

All levels are valuable *if* you are using them how they are meant to be used.

---

# Reading Like a Programmer

- Our job requires deep focus
- Focus is a skill
- Skills can be improved with dedicated practice

Without this skill, we can't access lower levels of technical reading. 

---

# While You Read

Do two things, one for you, one for class:

1. Keep a list of everything that distracts you.
2. Keep a list of thoughts, questions, and epiphanies.

---

# Distractions?

- I won't ask you about them.
- Knowing them will help you avoid them.
- One of the best habits for practicing deepfocus.

---

# Discussions

- Thoughts: anything that surpised or interested you
- Questions: anything that confused you or made you curious to learn something else
- Epiphanies: any connections to other concepts or sudden insights

We'll use these in group discussions.
