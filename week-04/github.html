# Creating a GitHub Repo

[Here's a Guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo)

But, it depends:
- Do you already have a local repo with commits?
- Or do you want a brand new repo?

---

# Creating a GitHub Repo

## Option 1

1. You've already ran .eight[git init] locally
2. Click .eight[+] and name your new repo on GitHub
3. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with a README"
4. Locally, use .eight[git remote add] to point to the GitHub repo
5. Then push your code to the remote

---

# Creating a GitHub Repo

## Option 1

```bash
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
$ git push -u origin master
```

---

# Creating a GitHub Repo

## Option 2

1. Click .eight[+] and name your new repo on GitHub
2. **Check** "Initialize with a README" which is your first commit
3. Optionally, add a .eight[.gitignore] file and a License
4. Locally, use .eight[git clone] to download your new repo

---

# Creating a GitHub Repo

## Option 2

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
$ cd repo
```

The .eight[clone] command will create a directory with your repo name in your current working directory. Make sure you're in the right spot!

---

# Pushing to Origin

By now, you've used one of the previous options and have a local repo tracking a remote repo.

```bash
$ git add path/to/files
$ git commit
$ git push
```

.eight[Push] will update all commits on your local branch, so you can commit many times before pushing.

---

# Don't Force It

If the remote has changes that you don't have, .eight[git push] will fail.

```bash
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:user/repo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

---

# Updating From Changed Origin

Situation: both local and remote have new but different commits. You want your changes to be applied __after__ the remote's changes.

```bash
$ git pull --rebase
  # gets remote commits, applies yours after
$ git push
```

If the rebase works, then you can push your new changes.

# Pull Requests

You can't force your changes on other people.

[Read more here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)

---

# Submitting Pull Requests

I'll give you access to a repo so you can make a change.

1. Clone my repo locally.
2. Make a new branch with your name
3. Checkout your branch, edit the file, add and commit.
4. Push your new branch to the remote
5. [Follow this guide to submit a PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

---

# Creating Forks

Create a copy of someone's repo to make your own changes.

1. [Read this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone your fork (see the next slide)
3. Make some changes
4. Submit a Pull Request to the original repo

---

# Cloning Forks

You can clone any repo you want!

Just make sure you're looking at the right repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com/me/repo.git
$ git clone git@github.com/you/repo.git
```

---

# Submitting Issues

Issues are a way to communicate about repos: sharing bugs, wanted features, or simply ideas.

[Read how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)

You can mention users, highlight code sections, and a ton more.
