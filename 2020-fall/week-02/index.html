      <h3>Project:</h3>
      <p>
        The graded project this week is on problem solving using our basic building block algorithms. Go to <a href="https://repl.it/teacher/classrooms/211664" target="_blank">the repl.it classroom</a> and complete <strong>three Wk 2: Project Problems</strong>. Everyone must complete problem <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, but you can choose which version of problem <strong>C</strong> you solve based on your level of comfort this week. Here is the grading breakdown for each problem:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>6 points</strong>: Show the correct steps in comments</li>
        <li><strong>3 points</strong>: Produce the correct solution in code</li>
        <li><strong>1 point</strong>: Follow the style guidelines</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Assessment:</h3>
      <p>Go to your <code>cset</code> repo on GitHub and create a new file in the <code>105</code> folder called <code>assessment-2.md</code>. Add your answers to the following questions to the file and "commit" them to GitHub. Here are the <a href="https://ts-cset.github.io/first-year/policies/assessments/">guidelines</a> if you forget them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?</li>
        <li>Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do...while</code>.</li>
        <li>We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?</li>
      </ul>

            <li>The first two lessons, "Introduction" and "Conditionals" will closely match this week's chapter.</li>
            <li>They introduce "Functions," "Scope," and "Arrays" next. We haven't learned so don't worry about them yet. Although some parts of lesson six on "Loops" will rely on them.</li>

            <li>The lessons "Comment Your JavaScript Code" through "Understand String Immutability" will match this week's chapters. If you get to "Arrays," you're going beyond what we're learning.</li>
            <li>This lesson uses an older version of JavaScript, so look at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/" target="_blank">the first three lessons</a> in their unit on ES6, the version of JS we're learning.</li>
