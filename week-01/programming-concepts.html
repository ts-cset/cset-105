# Phone Book Problem

Let's say you want to find your friend Mike Smith in the phone book. Write an algorithm that would you could follow to find him.

---

# Phone Book Problem

.eight[Option #1]

Start at the beginning, flip through each page one at a time until we find him or get to the end.

---

# Phone Book Problem

.eight[Option #2]

Start at the beginning, flip through pages **two** at a time until we find him or get to the end.

---

# Phone Book Problem

.eight[Option #3]

Open to the middle and see what letter you're at. Throw away the half of the book that you know he isn't in. Repeat this until you find him, dividing the problem in half each time.

```
 0 pick up phone book
 1 open to middle of phone book
 2 look at names
 3 if Smith is among names
 4     call Mike
 5 else if Smith is earlier in book
 6     open to middle of left half of book
 7     go back to step 2
 8 else if Smith is later in book
 9     open to middle of right half of book
10     go back to step 2
11 else
12     quit

# Files and Folders

---
count: false

# Files and Folders

.eight[Everything is stored in a file.]

- Files are just buckets of bits stored in the hard drive
- File names are really addresses of where those bits are stored
- Folders aren't containers, they're special files that list a bunch of file names.

From now on, we'll call these addresses the file .eight[path].
