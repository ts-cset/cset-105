# Binary Is More Than Numbers

- ASCII, common pattern to translate
- .eight[65] means "A", .eight[66] means "B"...
- Computer uses context to figure out what the binary means

.eight[Bit]: One binary digit
.eight[Byte]: Eight bits

# .fourteen[How many symbols are there?]

---

# Abstraction

- Lower levels are hidden
- We use easier higher levels

We don't need binary, we'll use a programming language

---

# Pseudocode

- Not a real programming language, just an abstraction
- Looks like english
